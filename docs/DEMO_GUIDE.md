## Common Questions & Answers

**Q: How does the AI detect delays?**
A: It connects to your existing scheduling software (Primavera P6, MS Project) and analyzes updates against baselines, while simultaneously monitoring emails and documents for related evidence.

**Q: What about data security?**
A: All data is encrypted at rest and in transit. We're SOC 2 compliant and can deploy on-premise if required.

**Q: How accurate is the AI?**
A: The AI provides confidence scores for each finding. In practice, we see 85%+ accuracy, and users can always review and adjust before submission.

**Q: Integration effort?**
A: Typically 2-3 days for full integration with existing systems. We handle the entire setup process.
