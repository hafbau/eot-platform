**Describe your go-to-market strategy and plans for scaling your startup.**

Go-to-Market: Deep Pilot Engagement

Phase 1 (Months 1-6): Proof of Concept
Target 2-3 pilots through warm intros from advisors (Wesley's PayShepherd network, Karim's ProTenders relationships). Strategy: 60-90 day paid pilots ($2K/month) with their actual P6 data, focusing on one active dispute or recently submitted claim. Dedicate full team support to ensure success. Each pilot gets white-glove service; we'll manually process data if needed.
Goal: One compelling case study showing specific dollar recovery.

Phase 2 (Months 6-9): Reference-Based Expansion
Convert pilots to annual contracts ($5-10K/month). Use proven ROI to approach 3-5 similar contractors in same market. Focus on relationship building: attending industry events, speaking at contractor associations, publishing case studies. Price below procurement thresholds to avoid lengthy RFP processes.
Goal: Understand pricing and most impactful business model.

Phase 3 (Months 10-12): Success Fee Model
Introduce performance-based pricing for larger opportunities—lower monthly fee plus 5-10% of recovered claims. This reduces customer risk and accelerates decision-making. Target contractors with known disputes or projects entering delay territory.
Scaling Reality:

Direct sales only in Year 1: Founder-led, relationship-driven, high-touch support
Geographic focus: Start with USA, Canada & Middle East (strongest advisor network), prove model, then expand
Channel partnerships: Year 2+ initiative after proven product-market fit
Team scaling: One customer success hire after 5 paying customers

Realistic metrics: 2 pilots Month 3, first paying customer Month 4-6, $300K revenue Year 1 (combination of subscriptions and success fees).

**What is your main competitive advantage?**

Unique founder-market fit: I'm likely the only person who has scheduled mega-projects ($6.6B Qatar World Cup), analyzed delays as a forensic expert, AND built enterprise AI processing massive data daily at Cribl. This isn't theoretical, I've prepared claims that won in arbitration and know exactly what evidence wins. Competitors are either construction consultants trying to learn AI or tech companies trying to learn construction. We're already fluent in both.

Focus on claim generation, not just tracking or predictions: While Oracle Primavera and Procore stop at schedule monitoring and predictions, we complete the entire workflow; from detection to evidence assembly to generating the actual submission package in under 10 minutes. We're solving the expensive part: the 80+ hours of manual document hunting and narrative writing that causes contractors to abandon legitimate claims.

Speed as a moat: By the time competitors realize claims automation is the killer app in construction tech, we'll have processed thousands of claims, refined our models with real arbitration outcomes, and locked in enterprise contractors who won't switch once we're handling their claims pipeline.

**Do any founders or team members have prior experience in the AEC industry? If yes, please provide details**

Yes, I bring 8+ years of hands-on construction experience across the entire project lifecycle:

Qatar World Cup Portfolio (2014-2016): PMO Scheduler at Supreme Committee for Delivery & Legacy, coordinating 700+ contractors on $6.6B of infrastructure. Built predictive analytics that kept FIFA's timeline on track while managing complex interfaces between multiple mega-projects.

Forensic Delay Analysis (2011-2014): Senior Planning Engineer at CEG International, analyzing claims and disputes for major Doha projects. Prepared and defended Extension of Time claims, conducted Time Impact Analysis, and served as scheduling expert in arbitrations; seeing exactly what wins and loses.

Project Controls (2009-2011): Planning Specialist at Integrated Technology, implementing Primavera P6 for infrastructure projects. Experienced the pain of manual claim preparation firsthand.

Education: Master of Laws in Construction Law & Practice from University of Salford, plus Higher National Diploma in Quantity Surveying—formal training in contracts, claims, and construction economics.

Recent: While running Leadev Software, I built AI solutions for construction clients including a lessons-learned knowledge management system for PayShepherd, helping contractors capture and apply project insights; bridging my construction and AI expertise.

This progression from scheduler to delay analyst to software builder, gives me unique insight into every stakeholder's perspective: subcontractor, GC, owner, consultant, and now technology provider.

**Does or will your business create a social impact? If yes, please explain and clarify if this impact is local, national or global. If no, please answer N/A.**

Yes, our impact spans North America and the Middle East, with potential for global reach.

Industry-Wide Efficiency:
We're reducing the $177B annual cost of construction delays by making claims transparent and evidence-based for ALL parties. Owners get properly documented claims they can evaluate quickly rather than inflated demands that trigger lengthy disputes. Project management consultants gain real-time visibility into delay causes, enabling prevention rather than litigation. Contractors receive fair compensation for legitimate delays. This transparency reduces the adversarial nature of construction, keeping projects focused on completion rather than courtroom battles.

Economic Impact:
Faster claim resolution means capital isn't tied up in disputes for years. Projects complete closer to schedule. Public infrastructure serves communities sooner. The 5-15% typically reserved for "claim contingency" can go toward actual construction. In our launch markets (USA, Canada, Middle East) representing $800B+ in annual construction, even a 1% efficiency gain means $8B more invested in building rather than fighting.

Human Impact:
We're ending the 60+ hour weeks that burn out project managers on all sides; contractor, owner, and consultant. By automating claim documentation, teams focus on problem solving rather than finger pointing.

Scale: Regional launch, global potential as construction modernizes worldwide.


**What makes your solution innovative and disruptive in the AEC-Tech industry?**

We're bringing AI document intelligence from deep tech into construction claims; a critical gap in the AEC tech stack. While existing tools track schedules, none automate the complex process of claim preparation and evidence assembly.

Our innovation:
AI-powered causation analysis: Our system analyzes schedule logic, meetings, email patterns, and document trails to determine delay responsibility and build the causal narrative

Automated evidence assembly: Instead of 80+ hours manually searching, we use NLP to extract relevant minutes of meetings, emails, daily reports, RFIs, and documents based on temporal and contextual relevance

Progressive disclosure interface: Complex claims analysis presented simply: paste an email about a delay, get a complete contract-compliant submission

Forensic-grade Time Impact Analysis: Automated fragnet insertion and window analysis that typically requires specialist consultants

The disruption: We're democratizing claims expertise. Today, only companies that can afford $500 - $1500/hour consultants pursue claims properly. Our platform makes this capability accessible to every project manager at around $5K/month. By combining construction domain expertise (scheduling $6.6B in projects, forensic delay analysis) with enterprise AI experience (10TB daily processing at Cribl), we're automating what the industry assumed would always require manual expert intervention.

**Please provide a descriptive sentence of your product/service and what solution you offer in your operating market.**

EOT Intel is an AI platform that monitors construction schedules 24/7, automatically detects claimable delays with evidence, and generates contract-compliant Extension of Time submissions in under 10 minutes, enabling contractors to capture millions in missed claims while reducing claim preparation time from 80+ hours to minutes.
